<p>Piggery health is a combination of good management practices, proper feeding, a clean environment, disease prevention, and regular health monitoring. By keeping your pigs healthy, you improve productivity, reduce the risk of diseases, and ensure that your piggery operates efficiently. Regular consultations with a veterinarian, monitoring pig health, and implementing biosecurity measures will help protect your herd and lead to a successful pig farming business.</p>
